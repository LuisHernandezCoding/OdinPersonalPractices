# odinPersonalPractices
Personal practices from The Odin Project

-------
The first intention is to make all the practices from TOP on only 1 Repo
Each folder contains a practice
on each practice i will first do it as it came on the curriculum
and after certain time, i will "improvise" 
so it will end better looking (front end) or cleaner code (back end)

Maybe i will make a separated branch for improvisation but only if it gets necessary


--------------

So in a new assignment i have to make a new repository so i will only put here what is not indicated to have its own repository
